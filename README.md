## 📖 Project Description

MedGPT is revolutionizing the way doctors and patients interact. Before a doctor even meets their patient, they can have a comprehensive understanding of the patient's concerns and conditions. Through a chatbot conversation, patients provide detailed information, which is then analyzed and can be relayed to the doctor. This ensures that even before the actual consultation, doctors are well-prepared.

**🛠 Technologies Used:**
- React Native
- OpenAI API

**🚧 Challenges Faced:**
- Navigating the intricacies of the OpenAI API, especially prompt engineering.

**🔜 Future Improvements:**
- Integration of an LLM (Language Model) specifically tailored for the medical field to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 🔧 Installation

1. 📥 Ensure all prerequisites required by React Native are installed.
2. 🔑 Obtain a key for the OpenAI API.
3. 📦 Install OpenAI.

## 🚀 Usage

Post-installation, users can interact with the chatbot. After the chat, an analysis is provided, which can then be sent to the doctor, giving them a preliminary understanding of the patient's needs.

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Patient-Chatbot Interaction:** 
  * **Gathering Information:** The chatbot engages with the patient to gather detailed information about their condition.
  * **Analysis:** Post-conversation, an in-depth analysis is generated.
  * **Relaying to Doctors:** The analysis can be sent to doctors, ensuring they're informed even before the actual consultation.
